	A list of symbols, operators, and units used in this doctoral dissertation is presented below.
	%	It is the author's intention to use the notation as consistently as possible.
	Ambiguities and double meaning of symbols and operators have been avoided as much as possible.
	However, the notations might be redefined in the accepted manuscripts presented from Chapters x to x, as those are presented in the form they were accepted for publication.
	The manuscript under review in Chapter x also has notations that differ from the ones defined herein.
	Notwithstanding, it is the author's intention to use the notation as consistently as possible throughout the text. %is Doctoral dissertation.
