	The abbreviations and acronyms used in this doctoral dissertation are listed below.
	The goal is to keep, as much as possible, a consistent notation throughout the text. 
	%Ambiguities and double meaning have been avoided as much as possible.
	%However, the notations might be redefined in the accepted manuscripts presented from Chapters x to x, as those are presented in the form they were accepted for publication.
	%The manuscript under review in Chapter x also has notations that differ from the ones defined herein.
